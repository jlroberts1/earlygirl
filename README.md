# Earlygirl

Early Girl is a cultivar of tomato with indeterminate growth, which means it produces flowers and fruit until it is killed by frost or another external factor.

Maybe today it's agile. Maybe it's just you forgot lunch.

Earlygirl here is a small Pomodoro timer made using Rust :crab: and the Iced :ice_cube:, a cross platform GUI library for Rust.
